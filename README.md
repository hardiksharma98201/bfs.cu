Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm that explores
nodes in layers, beginning from a source node and expanding outward by visiting all
neighboring nodes before proceeding to the next level. It is widely used in applications
such as shortest path finding in unweighted graphs, network routing, web crawling, and
social network analysis.
